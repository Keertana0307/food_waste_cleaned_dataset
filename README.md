# Food Waste Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

This repository contains the cleaned dataset for predicting food waste quantities using multiple machine learning and deep learning models.

---

- **data/**  
  Contains the cleaned dataset used for all experiments.

## Dataset

The cleaned dataset contains food waste records with operational, environmental, and categorical attributes.  
All preprocessing steps (handling missing values, zero-value filtering, and feature standardisation) are documented in the preprocessing notebook.
